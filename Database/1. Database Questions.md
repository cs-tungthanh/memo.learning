1. What are the properties of a transaction? - **ACID**
2. What is a primary key / Composite Key / Composite Primary Key / Foreign Key / Unique Key?
3. Define Join and explain different types of joins.
4. What is the difference between **Clustered** and **Non-clustered Index**?
5. What is data normalization? **NF1, NF2, NF3**
6. What are **optimistic** and **pessimistic** locking
7. What is **Two-phase locking**? - it is differ with 2 phase commit
8. SUBQUERY???

## How to choose the right database
- Read/Write Heavy or balanced workload?
- Throughput need? Will it change, does it need to scale or fluctuate during the day?
- how much, how long data to be stored? will it grow? average object size? How are they accessed?
- Data durability? source of truth for the data?
- Latency requirement? Concurrent users?
- Data model? how will query the data? structured ? semi-structured?
- strong schema? more flexibility? reporting? search? 
- License cost? 

`CREATE INDEX IDX_LAST_NAME ON emp (LAST_NAME);`

B-TREE INDEX không thể lưu trữ được giá trị NULL.
`select * from emp where last_name is null`

→ cannot use index to optimize

```sql
CREATE TABLE wecommit_emp_normal
(
	id NUMBER (10),
	name VARCHAR2 (50),
	salary NUMBER
);

BEGIN
    FOR i IN 1 .. 1000000
    LOOP
        INSERT INTO wecommit_emp_normal
                 VALUES (i,
                         DBMS_RANDOM.string ('H', 50),
                         trunc(DBMS_RANDOM.VALUE (1000, 7000)));
        IF MOD (i, 1000) = 0
        THEN
            COMMIT;
        END IF;
    END LOOP;
END;

CREATE TABLE wecommit_emp_random
AS
SELECT
*
FROM wecommit_emp_normal
ORDER BY DBMS_RANDOM.random;
```

## Strategy for heavy-read systems
### 1. Indexing
> Analyzing the query patterns of your app and create the right indexs.
### 2. Replication
### 4. Sharding

### 5. Caching
### 6. Content delivery network (CDN)
- Cache and serve static content closer to end users and reduce read latency.
- Scenario:
	- User A request to CDN.
	- CDN fetches the data from Origin server.
	- CDN responds to User A and it also caches the data for future request.
### 7. Materialized views
- Pre-compute the complex query result and store them for faster access in the future.

### 8. Denormalization
- Reduce complex joins to improve the query performance 
- Example: we have 3 tables: Products, Customers, Users 
	- we can merge them together: Customers Orders
